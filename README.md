# Time Series Playground

A simple Shiny app for Time Series modeling using ARIMA and model evaluation.
We use the [US Candy Production by Month](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/us-candy-production-by-month) data, tracks industrial production every month from January 1972 to August 2017.

The app is available [here](https://avivnav.shinyapps.io/tsplayground/).
